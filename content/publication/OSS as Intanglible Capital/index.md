abstract = """Open source software is everywhere, both as specialized applications nurtured by devoted user communities, and as digital infrastructure underlying platforms used by millions daily, yet its value and impact are not currently measured (with small exceptions). We develop an approach to document the scope and impact of open source software created by all sectors of the economy: businesses, universities, government research institutions, nonprofits, and individuals. We use a bottom-up approach to measure subset of OSS projects and languages, collecting data on open source software languages R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript, as well as from the Federal Government’s code.gov website. Using lines of code and a standard model to estimate package developer time, we convert lines of code to resource cost. We estimate that the resource cost for developing R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript exceeds $3 billion dollars, based on 2017 costs. Applying this approach to open source software available on code.gov results in an estimated value of more than $1 billion, based on 2017 costs, as a lower bound for the resource cost of this software. We analyze the dependencies between software packages through network analysis and estimate re-use statistics. This reuse is one measure of relative impact.
